# accelerometer
This project gets the readings from the Android accelerometer and save the readings into the local SQLite database first. Then you might consider exporting the readings in the CSV format into the device's external memory which can be shared later with others.

This is basically developed for a class project as we could not find any free application in the Google Play Store that provides a feasible export option to share the readings from the accelerometer of the device with others via Email or WhatsApp.

User needs to grant the permission to write/read the external storage, as this is required to export the readings as a CSV file into the external directory.
